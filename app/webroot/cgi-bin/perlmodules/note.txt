The cgi-bin/perlmodules folder is empty by default, but it's there so that if
your server is missing any of the Perl modules that FileChucker needs (or that
it can optionally use), then you have a ready-made place to put them:
FileChucker will automatically search this folder when attempting to load its
Perl modules.
